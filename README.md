## Features of the Project

The Google Maps map will focus immediately on the position of the user. <br />
A specific color marker should be shown at the user's current location. <br />

Data will be drawn from the Google Places API <br />

Restaurants will be displayed on the map according to their GPS coordinates. <br />
Restaurants that are currently visible on the map should be displayed in list form on the side of the map as mentioned above. <br />
You will see the average reviews of each restaurant (ranging from 1 to 5 stars). <br />

Clicking on a restaurant will provide a list of reviews and comments as well as the corresponding picture of the restaurant (if it is available) using the Google Street View API. <br />

A filter tool allows the display of restaurants that have between 0 and 5 stars and vice versa. <br /> 
The map will display accurately to the corresponding restaurants. <br />

Once a review or restaurant has been added, it should appear immediately on the map. A new marker will show the position of the new restaurant. <br />

The information will only be saved for the duration of the visit <br />
